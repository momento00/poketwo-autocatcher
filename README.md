### Adding Autocatcher Tokens

- **Method 1 (Recommended)**: Use the slash command `/token`
  1. Start the bot
  2. Run `/token action:add tokens:<your_tokens>`
  3. Supports mass adding up to 25 tokens at once
  4. Accepts formats: standalone token or `mail:pass:token`
  5. Use `/token action:remove` to remove tokens
  6. Use `/token action:check` to verify token status

- **Method 2**: Use the stats button interface
  1. Run the `/stats` command
  2. Click the "Add Token" button to add new tokens
  3. Use the "Remove Token" button to remove tokens

- **Method 3**: Edit the `data/tokens.json` file directly

```json
[
  "YOUR_SELFBOT_TOKEN_HERE",
  "ANOTHER_SELFBOT_TOKEN_HERE"
]
```

### Important

* All slash commands are global and work in both DMs and servers.
* For the best experience, ensure your Discord account has proper permissions in the channels where catching occurs.
* Captcha solving requires a valid API key you can buy from [GraceShop](https://graceshop.mysellauth.com).
* AI catching requires a license key obtained by contacting `momento.de`.
* Make sure to add your Discord User ID to the `owners` array in config.js to control the bot commands.
* Use `/token` command for mass token management (up to 25 tokens at once).
